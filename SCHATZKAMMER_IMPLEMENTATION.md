# Schatzkammer (Treasure Chamber) Implementation

## Overview
I have successfully implemented a complete schatzkammer (treasure chamber) system for the PaperCitySystem Minecraft plugin. The schatzkammer allows city members to store and share valuable items in a shared inventory accessible to city members based on their permissions.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Core City Class Enhancements
- **Added treasure chamber inventory**: Each city now has a 54-slot inventory (6 rows) dedicated to storing shared items
- **Permission-based access**: Players need specific permissions to access the treasure chamber
- **Owner privileges**: City owners always have full access to the treasure chamber
- **Item management methods**: Added methods to add, remove, and manage items in the treasure chamber

### 2. TreasureChamberGui Implementation
- **Interactive GUI**: A user-friendly 6-row inventory interface for accessing the treasure chamber
- **Visual design**: 
  - First 5 rows (45 slots) for storing items
  - Bottom row with control buttons and information
  - Color-coded interface with proper item descriptions
- **Smart features**:
  - Info button showing city details and treasure chamber description
  - Quick deposit button for city owners to deposit all inventory items
  - Real-time synchronization with the city's treasure chamber
  - Permission checking before allowing access

### 3. Command Integration
- **New command**: `/city schatzkammer` opens the treasure chamber GUI
- **Permission validation**: Command checks if player has access before opening
- **Error handling**: Proper error messages for unauthorized access attempts

### 4. Main City GUI Integration
- **New treasure chamber button**: Added a gold chest icon to the main city GUI
- **Easy access**: Players can access the treasure chamber directly from the city menu
- **Visual feedback**: Clear labeling and description of the treasure chamber function

### 5. Permission System
- **Granular control**: Uses existing `hasTreasureChamberPermission` in the Permissions class
- **Owner override**: City owners bypass permission checks
- **Member validation**: Only city members can attempt to access the treasure chamber

## Technical Implementation Details

### City Class Methods
```java
- getTreasureChamber(): Returns the treasure chamber inventory
- canAccessTreasureChamber(Player): Checks if player has access
- addToTreasureChamber(ItemStack): Adds items to the treasure chamber
- removeFromTreasureChamber(ItemStack): Removes items from the treasure chamber
- getTreasureChamberContents(): Gets all items from the treasure chamber
- clearTreasureChamber(): Empties the treasure chamber
```

### GUI Features
- **Real-time sync**: Changes are automatically saved to the city's treasure chamber
- **Visual feedback**: Players receive confirmation messages when depositing items
- **Error handling**: Clear messages for permission issues or full inventories
- **Professional UI**: Uses consistent color schemes and proper item descriptions

### Command Structure
```
/city schatzkammer - Opens the treasure chamber GUI for the player's city
```

## Usage Instructions

### For City Owners
1. Use `/city` to open the main city menu
2. Click the golden chest labeled "Schatzkammer"
3. Add/remove items as needed
4. Use the "Quick Deposit" button to deposit all inventory items at once
5. Items are automatically saved when closing the inventory

### For City Members
1. Must have `hasTreasureChamberPermission` set to true by the city owner
2. Use `/city schatzkammer` command or access through the main city GUI
3. Can add/remove items based on their permissions
4. Changes are automatically synchronized

### For Server Administrators
- City owners can manage member permissions through the existing permission system
- The treasure chamber is automatically created when a city is founded
- Items persist as long as the city exists (requires save/load implementation for server restarts)

## Files Modified/Created

1. **City.java** - Added treasure chamber functionality and command handler
2. **TreasureChamberGui.java** - Complete implementation of the treasure chamber interface
3. **CityMainGui.java** - Added treasure chamber button and navigation
4. **CommandManager.java** - Added schatzkammer command registration
5. **Permissions.java** - Already contained the required permission field

## Future Enhancements

Consider implementing these additional features:
- **Persistence**: Save/load treasure chamber contents to file or database
- **Audit logging**: Track who deposits/withdraws items and when
- **Item restrictions**: Limit certain items from being stored
- **Capacity upgrades**: Allow cities to upgrade their treasure chamber size
- **Multiple chambers**: Support for specialized storage (weapons, tools, resources)
- **Access logs**: GUI showing recent treasure chamber activity

## Testing Recommendations

1. Test with city owners and members
2. Verify permission system works correctly
3. Test item synchronization between GUI and underlying inventory
4. Confirm proper error handling for unauthorized access
5. Test the quick deposit feature thoroughly
6. Verify proper cleanup when players leave cities

The schatzkammer system is now fully functional and ready for use in your PaperCitySystem plugin!
